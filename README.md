# DaisyMultiLooper
 A multi-channel looper based on the Daisy Seed. All loops are synchronised with the length being determined by the primary (first) loop length. Each loop can be turned on/off individually. If all are off, playback goes to the start. The first recording waits for the first sound after being armed.
